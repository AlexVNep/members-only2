# Clubhouse Messaging App

A private clubhouse messaging app built with **Next.js** and **Auth.js** for authentication, using **PostgreSQL** as the database. Users can sign up, create messages, and join the private club by entering a secret passcode. Admins can manage messages.

## Features

- User authentication with **Auth.js**
- MongoDB database for storing users and messages
- Secure password hashing using **bcrypt**
- Membership system with a secret passcode
- Role-based access control (Members & Admins)
- Message creation and restricted viewing based on membership
- Admins can delete messages

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (React framework)
- **Auth.js** (Authentication)
- **MongoDB** (Database)
- **Mongoose** (ORM for database management)
- **bcrypt** (Password hashing)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling)
